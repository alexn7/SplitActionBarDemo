Demo for meizu split actionbar issue

When you click the refresh button, buttons in the split actionbar would move to th right a bit, which never happened in other platform, only on my meizu MX Flyme 2.1.3.
This issue also happens in the old Gmail client in my phone, the new design of Gmail does not use splitactionbar any more.
